## What are the risks of using Scallop Pools?

All DeFi protocols, including Scallop, come with risks, which are important to understand before depositing significant amounts of crypto. The main risks involved in using Scallop are outlined here.

#### Regulatory risk

The regulatory status of Scallop, $SCA and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of digital assets has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including $SCA and/or Scallop. Regulatory actions could negatively impact $SCA and/or Scallop in various ways. The Company, the Distributor (or their respective affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors to mitigate the legal risks as much as possible, the Company and Distributor have worked with the specialist blockchain department at Jacque Law LLC and obtained a legal opinion on the token distribution, and will be conducting business in accordance with the prevailing market practice.

**Smart Contract Risk**

This is a risk that the Scallop smart contracts get exploited to steal or permanently freeze funds. This risk is inherent to all smart contracts and can never be fully eliminated, but can be mitigated in various ways.

#### Cross Program Invocation Risk

Scallop relies on some cross-program invocation to earn the yield, such as Solend and Marinade. There is a risk that these programs got exploited or some unexpected accidents. These risks are inherent to all smart contract invocations.

**Oracle Risk**

Scallop relies on Switchboard for their VRF feeds to pick winners. There is a risk that these oracles report incorrect randomness, causing wrongful winners.

#### Wallet Providers **Risk**

Scallop is compatible with a wide range of wallets, including Phantom, Solflare, Math Wallet, Coin98, Slope, and an open-source Solana wallet called Sollet.io. A wallet exploit could affect the user.

#### Risk of insufficient information

As at the date hereof, Scallop is still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this material contains the most current information relating to Scallop, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Scallop Project Contributors from time to time. The Scallop Project Contributors has neither the ability nor obligation to keep holders of $SCA informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop Scallop, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

#### Competitive Risk

Various types of decentralised applications, games and networks are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying $SCA and/or Scallop and attempt to re-create similar facilities. Scallop may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact $SCA and/or Scallop.

#### Risk of failure to develop

There is the risk that the development of Scallop will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or $SCA, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

## Is Scallop Pools Solana on-chain program audited/open-source?

Scallop program hasn't been audited, Scallop team uses Anchor framework to build Scallop program, and Scallop core members have done a strict detailed team code review for Scallop program with Switchboard, Socean teams, and Scallop advisors.
