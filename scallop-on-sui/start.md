To acquire Tokens on the Sui Network via a cross-chain transfer, you can utilize the [Wormhole Connect](https://app.scallop.io/bridge). Wormhole is a multi-chain messaging protocol capable of connecting to several chains, such as Ethereum, Solana, Terra, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Sui, Avalanche, and Oasis.

Here's an easy-to-follow guide to get you started:

* Navigate to the Bridge section at Scallop or head to the Wormhole Connect page.
* Determine the blockchain from which you wish to transfer assets, then select SUI Network as the target. At this point, link your Metamask Wallet.
* Choose the token type to be transferred (WBTC, WETH, USDC or USDT) and indicate the quantity.
* Lastly, link your Sui wallet, cover the gas costs on Sui, and approve the transactions for both sending and claiming.
