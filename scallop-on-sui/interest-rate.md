# Interest Rate & Fees

## Dynamics Interest Rate

At Scallop, interest rates for borrowing are determined by static linear (or piecewise linear) models. In a general sense, as the demand for borrowing rises or the supply diminishes, interest rates experience an upward trend. Conversely, when the supply increases or the demand for borrowing declines, interest rates decrease accordingly.

## Fees

As always, the protocol's fee parameters are dynamic and can be adjusted through governance as the performance and health of the protocol are continually assessed. \
