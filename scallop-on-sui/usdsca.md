## $SCA Utility features

#### Liquidity mining: &#x20;

$SCA emissions on deposits & borrows. Scallop itself is simply a set of deployed smart contracts which does not offer any resources for utilisation. As such, to ensure that the protocol is able to perform its core peer-to-peer money market functions other users would need to be incentivised to deposit into or borrow from into the protocol. As compensation for opportunity costs, these participants which help to promote adoption of Scallop by staking or including assets to liquidity pools would be rewarded with $SCA (i.e. "liquidity mining" on Scallop), according to each user's relative contribution after various adjustment and correction parameters. By distributing $SCA in this manner, it ensures that the governance token will be distributed primarily to key network contributors and allow them to have a say in protocol parameters.

&#x20;

Governance & Voting: $SCA would allow holders to propose and vote on governance proposals to determine future features, modifications and/or parameters of Scallop, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked. The right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Scallop; it does not entitle $SCA holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors or similar bodies of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, nor does $SCA constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership. After governance launch there will be no individual or corporate entity or other active promoter, sponsor, or group or affiliated party that maintains sole control over Scallop.

&#x20;

Borrowing Interests Fee discount ~~:~~ : $SCA tokens can be employed to provide discounts on borrowing interests fee for users holding a predetermined amount of tokens, thereby creating additional utility for $SCA.

&#x20;

Payment: Direct usage of credit card to spend $SCA everywhere Visa and Mastercard is allowed. As a network effect, users may keep their $SCA in their wallet and utilise it for spending with any third party, merchant or service provider un-related to the platform that is willing to accept these $SCA as the settlement currency for the transaction.



#### Liquidity Mining

Only users who supply/borrow into Scallop pools activate eligibility to receive SCA emissions within the peer-to-peer money market. $SCA Liquidity mining emissions can be instantly claimed for the total amount.

(Alternatively, emissions may be vested for three months. Vesting SCA may be claimed early for an exit penalty to receive 10-75% of rewards, decaying linearly during the three-month vesting period. )
