# Liquidations

#### **Min. Collateral Ratio**

#### **Scallop Liquidation BOT Github Repo:**  **Liquidation Threshold**  Liquidation Penalty

A 9% liquidation fee is applied to the collateral portion that undergoes liquidation. This takes place when your risk indicator (refer to the terminology page for the risk indicator definition or the margin accounts page for more information) exceeds 1.0, prompting a portion of your collateral position to be liquidated to reduce your risk factor below 1.0. If multiple collateral types are present in your deposit, the current liquidator version selects a random collateral type to partially liquidate, restoring your risk factor to a safe level.\
