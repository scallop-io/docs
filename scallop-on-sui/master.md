# Start

## 1. Sui Wallet

These are the Scallop recommended Sui wallets:

* [**Sui Wallet**](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mysten-app-docs/blob/main/mysten-sui-wallet.md)
* [**Martian**](https://martianwallet.xyz/)
* [**Ethos**](https://twitter.com/EthosWalletXYZ)
* [**Elli**](https://elliwallet.com/)
* [**Suiet**](https://suiet.app/)

1. Install a wallet you like.
2. Create a password. (This password is for this browser, in case bad guys steal your tokens by stealing your laptop or use it without asking, etc.)
3. Save your mnemonic. Do not let anybody know your mnemonic, save it safely. ([Best Ways to Store Your Mnemonic Passphrase and How](https://cryptoadventure.com/best-ways-to-store-your-mnemonic-passphrase-and-how/))
4. Now you can copy your Sui address and send your SUI to your wallet!

`//TODO`

#### Transferable Subaccounts

In Scallop, we calculate your collateral and your debt inside an object called `Obligation`. To mutate this object you will need an object called `Obligation Key`, each `Obligation Key` belongs to an `Obligation` object. So when you create an `Obligation` object for the first time, you will get `Obligation Key` in return and it will be stored inside your address. This `Obligation Key` is just like an NFT, it represents ownership and itâ€™s transferable. Transferring your `Obligation Key` to the other address means you hand over your ownership to someone else.
