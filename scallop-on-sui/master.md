### Transferable Sub-accounts

Scallop offers the flexibility for every user's Sui address to access up to 5 sub-accounts, including the primary account. This enables users to efficiently manage multiple positions concurrently. Once a user holds Scallop`Obligation Key`, they can deposit into any sub-account without the need for repetitive approvals. Furthermore, no approvals are necessary to transfer assets and liabilities between sub-accounts, empowering users to easily isolate and segregate their collateral and debts according to their preferences

We calculate your collateral and your debt inside an object called `Obligation`. To mutate this object you will need an object called `Obligation Key`, each `Obligation Key` belongs to an `Obligation` object. So when you create an `Obligation` object for the first time, you will get `Obligation Key` in return and it will be stored inside your address. This `Obligation Key` is just like an NFT, it represents ownership and itâ€™s transferable. Transferring your `Obligation Key` to the other address means you hand over your ownership to someone else.
