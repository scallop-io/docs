3. Save your mnemonic. Do not let anybody know your mnemonic, save it safely. ([Best Ways to Store Your Mnemonic Passphrase and How](https://cryptoadventure.com/best-ways-to-store-your-mnemonic-passphrase-and-how/))

#### Transferable Subaccounts

In Scallop, we calculate your collateral and your debt inside an object called `Obligation`. To mutate this object you will need an object called `Obligation Key`, each `Obligation Key` belongs to an `Obligation` object. So when you create an `Obligation` object for the first time, you will get `Obligation Key` in return and it will be stored inside your address. This `Obligation Key` is just like an NFT, it represents ownership and itâ€™s transferable. Transferring your `Obligation Key` to the other address means you hand over your ownership to someone else.
