# Marketing Coins

### Base Assets

As mentioned before, base assets are used if you want to be a **lender.** Specifically, by depositing to these pools you will be able to gain interest over your own coins. Your coins will be borrowed by the **borrower** and in return, you will get the interest from the **borrower**.

Depositing `x` coins to the base assets doesn’t make you able to borrow `x` worth of coins from other pools. It’s not possible to gain interest as a lender and borrow from other pools using the same coins. One coin is used for only one purpose, using it to gain interest or make it as collateral and borrow other coins.

When you deposit some coins to the **assets pools**, you will get Market Coins in return. Market Coins are proof that you deposited some coins to the **assets pools**. Market Coins have an ever-growing value.
