# Scallop Q&A üéô

### **Why Solana?**

Solana is a super fast, high security and composability, decentralized blockchain and Scallop team think Solana will be a world computer and be a part of all humans life, just like we are all the testimony of how the internet entered our world and changed everything. 



### Is Scallop a Defi gaming project?

You can say we're a gaming project or a no loss lottery project or even a NFTs project.  
We are a way you can stake your SOL to earn extra tokens and on-chain collectibles and NFTs.  
The presentation of the front-end will be a gradual evolution in the beta version. It will be more like a Defi project with simple animation, as time flows we will make it more like a 2D gaming project.



### **Why SOL?**

The gas fee of Solana is really low so we will use some swap program from other great project and swap it to the tokens which the highest APY pool needed, we are also planning to be a Solana Validator too so SOL might be a better choice. 



### How does Scallop program earn rewards with my tokens?

Our program will use the pool 's fund to earn rewards from :

* Staking SOL on Solana Validator.
* Lending at some lending project.
* Liquidity mining at some liquidity pool.

You can see where the funds will go at our front-end and users might can choose it in the future.



### How does Scallop program choose winners randomly?

We use Switchboard VRF which is a real random function on Solana and it will help our program to choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week  


###  What are Scallop Decorations? Are they NFTs?

You can call them Scallop Decorations, On Chain Collectibles, or NFTs \(Non-fungible tokens\).



### Will there be a SCA airdrop? If yes, what is the airdrop condition?

Well, there will be twice, we haven't set up our airdrop rules but it will not be filling google forms. Actually our core team love airdrop too but we want to have it without harming our tokenomic, so we will set a condition and limit for it.
