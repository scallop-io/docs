# Scallop Q&A üéô

### **Why Solana?**

Solana is a super fast, high security and composability, decentralized blockchain and Scallop team think Solana will be a world computer and be a part of all humans life, just like we are all the testimony of how internet entered our world and changed everything. 



### Is Scallop a Defi gaming project?

You can say it's a gaming project or a no loss lottery project or even a NFTs project.  
We are a way you can stake your SOL to earn extra tokens and on-chain collectibles and NFTs.  
The presentation of front-end will be a gradual evolution at beta ver. It will be like Defi with simple animation, as time flows we will make it more like 2D gaming.



### **Why SOL?**

The gas fee of Solana is really low so we will use some swap program from other great project and swap it to the tokens which the highest APY pool needed, we are also planning to be a Solana Validator too so SOL might be a better choice. 



### How do your program earn reward with my tokens?

Our program will use the funds to earn rewards from staking SOL or some trustworthy liquidity pool from another project \(e.g., ORCA, Serum\) or some great decentralized lending project.  
We will announced where did the funds go and user might can choose it in the future.



### How do Scallop program choose winners randomly?

We use Switchboard VRF on Solana , it's a real random function on blockchain which can help our program choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week.       


###  What are Scallop Decorations? Are they NFTs?

You can call them Scallop Decorations, On Chain Collectibles, or NFTs.



### Will there be a SCA airdrop? If yes, what is the airdrop condition?

Well, there will be twice, we haven't set up our airdrop rules but it will not be filling google forms. Actually our core team love airdrop too but we want to have it without harming our tokenomic, so we will set a limit for it.
