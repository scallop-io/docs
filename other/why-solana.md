# Scallop Q&A

### **Why Solana?**

Solana is a , secure , and and censorship resistant blockchain with Proof-of-History \(PoH\) network , which means that anyone who holds SOL tokens can choose to delegate some of their SOL to one or more validators, who process transactions and run the network. Solana was founded in 2017 from companies such as Intel, Google, Twitter, Netscape, and Qualcomm. Solana’s mission is to support all high-growth and high-frequency blockchain applications and to democratize the world’s financial systems. Furthermore, the system able to support an upper bound of 710,000 TPS on a standard gigabit network and 28.4 million TPS on a 40 gigabit network.



### **Why SOL?**

"Staking your SOL tokens on Solana is the best way you can help secure the world's highest-performing blockchain network, and earn rewards for doing so!" - These sentences are form Solana and we are planning to be a Solana Validator too.



### Is Scallop a simulation game?

You can say it's a game or a no loss lottery or a way to stake SOL and earn tokens and decorations.



### How do our program choose winners randomly?

We use Chainlink VRF on Solana , it's a real random function on blockchain which can help our program choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week.     



### Will there be a SCA airdrop? If yes, what is the airdrop condition?

Well, there will be twice, we haven't set up our airdrop rules but it will not be filling google forms. Actually our core team love airdrop too but we want to have it without harming our tokenomic, so we will set a limit for it.
