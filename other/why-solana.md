# Scallop Q&A

### **Why Solana?**

Solana is a really fast, high security, decentralized blockchain and we think Solana will be a world computer.



### **Why SOL?**

"Staking your SOL tokens on Solana is the best way you can help secure the world's highest-performing blockchain network, and earn rewards for doing so!" - These sentences are form Solana and we are planning to be a Solana Validator too.



### What will your program do with my tokens?

Our program will use the funds to earn rewards from staking SOL or some trustworthy liquidity pool from another project \(e.g., ORCA, Serum\) or some great decentralized lending project.  
We will announced where did the funds go and user might can choose it in the future.



### Is Scallop a simulation game?

You can say it's a game or a no loss lottery or a way to stake SOL and earn tokens and decorations.



### How do our program choose winners randomly?

We use Chainlink VRF on Solana , it's a real random function on blockchain which can help our program choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week.     



### Will there be a SCA airdrop? If yes, what is the airdrop condition?

Well, there will be twice, we haven't set up our airdrop rules but it will not be filling google forms. Actually our core team love airdrop too but we want to have it without harming our tokenomic, so we will set a limit for it.
