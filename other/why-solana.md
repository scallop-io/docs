# Scallop Q&A üéô

### **Why Solana?**

Solana is a super fast, high security and composability, decentralized blockchain and Scallop team think Solana will be a world computer and be a part of all humans life, just like we are all the testimony of how internet entered our world and changed everything. 



### **Why SOL?**

The gas fee of Solana is really low so we will use some swap program for other project and to what's the highest reward's pool need and we are also planning to be a Solana Validator too so SOL might be a better choice. 



### What will your program do with my tokens?

Our program will use the funds to earn rewards from staking SOL or some trustworthy liquidity pool from another project \(e.g., ORCA, Serum\) or some great decentralized lending project.  
We will announced where did the funds go and user might can choose it in the future.



### Is Scallop a simulation game?

You can say it's a game or a no loss lottery or a way to stake SOL and earn tokens and decorations.



### How do our program choose winners randomly?

We use Chainlink VRF on Solana , it's a real random function on blockchain which can help our program choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week.     



### Will there be a SCA airdrop? If yes, what is the airdrop condition?

Well, there will be twice, we haven't set up our airdrop rules but it will not be filling google forms. Actually our core team love airdrop too but we want to have it without harming our tokenomic, so we will set a limit for it.
