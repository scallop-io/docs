# Rules 👩‍🏫

### Rules📋**：**

Users can stake their tokens into Scallop Pools to grow scallops in Scallop Tank, while they stake tokens they will also get the same value of SCA \(Scallop Token\) of the token they stake. 

**Every Friday 20:00 \(GMT+8\) will be the harvest time**, users will have the qualification of harvesting after staking over 7 days.

After harvesting, one or a few winner\(s\) chosen by **Switchboard VRF** \(Verified Random Functions\) will share out the reward SCA \(With the same value of 93% staking reward\), 7% of staking reward will be kept in the staking pool and other will be SCA buyback.

There will be different tiers of pools with the different address limits, different SPL tokens to let users stake tokens, ex:

* 100 SCA/1000 address
* 100 RAY/1000 address
* 10 SOL/1000 address
* 100 SOL/100 address
* 100 USDC/∞ address

You can see where the funds will go, our program will use the fund of pools to earn rewards by:

* Stake SOL on Solana Validator.
* 
  Stake SPL tokens.

* 
  Lend to some lending projects.

* 
  Join some liquidity mining pool.

#### Notice🔎**：**

* If users keep staking, they can harvest every week.
* 
  Users can get back the token they staked while they return SCA and the return SCA will be burned.



### **Tasks**🏅**：**



We don’t want users to join us for months and get nothing so during the game: users can carry out some tasks like:

* Join 10 SOL pools over a month.
* 
  Stake more than 10K SCA over two weeks.

* 
  Offer $100 values to SCA/USDC Liquidity pools over a month.

To win:

* Scallop Decorations
* Extra SPL tokens
* SCA
* NFTs



Extra SPL token rewards will be the token minted by partnership projects, we will use SCA or Scallop Decorations to trade their tokens or NFTs.
