### Rulesüìã**Ôºö**

Users can deposit their tokens into Scallop Pools to grow scallops in Scallop tank and join the no-loss lottery, our program will use the deposited tokens to do staking/lending/liquidity mining to earn the lottery reward.

Every Friday 20:00 (UTC+8) will be the harvest time, winners chosen by **Switchboard VRF** (Verified Random Functions) will share out the reward (With the same value of 93% staking reward), and 7% of the lottery reward will be kept in the Scallop Pool.

Users can deposit any amount of SOL or SPL tokens, every time the deposit amount changes, users need to wait for another 7 days to join the lottery, the winning rate is the same as his tokens be deposited in the percentage of the pool token.

There will be different Scallop Pools with accepting different SPL tokens and different earning ways, ex:

* SOL no-loss lottery by deposit SOL to stake at **Marinade**.
* &#x20;RAY no-loss lottery by deposit RAY to stake RAY at **Raydium**.
* USDC no-loss lottery by deposit USDC to lend USDC at **Solend**.
* USDT no-loss lottery by deposit USDT and USDC (auto swap by Jupiter aggregator) to do LM at **Orca**.

* Stake SOL on Solana Validator or other SOL staking protocols.&#x20;
* Stake the SPL tokens which have their own staking program.&#x20;
