# Rules of Scallop üë©‚Äçüè´

### Rulesüìã**Ôºö**

Users can stake SOL to the Scallop tank and get a scallop to grow, after staking over 7 days users will have the qualification of harvest. Every Friday 20:00 \(GMT+8\) will be the harvest time. After harvesting, one \(or a few\) of winners chosen by program randomly will get Scallop token \(SCA\) with 100% the same value of SOL staking reward, 7% of SOL will be kept in the staking pool and 93% will be SCA buyback.

During the game users can win the Scallop Decorations by carrying out some tasks, like stake more than 10 SOL in the Scallop tank for a month or stake more than 10000 SCA in the staking pool for two weeks, we will show the tasks you can carry on our apps.

Our program will use the fund of pools to earn rewards from :

* Staking SOL on Solana Validator.
* Lending at some lending project.
* Liquidity mining at some liquidity pool.

 You can see where the funds will go on our front-end.

### Noticeüîé**Ôºö**

* The more you stake, the more you win, the more chance you will have of winning. 
* There will be extra partnership SPL token rewards. 
* If users don't unstake their SOL, they can keep staking and join the harvesting next week. 
* We are going to use Switchboard VRF which is a real random function on Solana that will help our program to choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week. 
* We will set up more pools with different maximum address limits or tokens for users!
