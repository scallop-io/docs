# Rules 👩‍🏫

### Rules📋**：**

Users can stake SOL to the Scallop tank and get a scallop to grow, after staking over 7 days users will have the qualification of harvest. Every Friday 20:00 \(GMT+8\) will be the harvest time. After harvesting, one \(or a few\) of winners chosen by program randomly will get Scallop token \(SCA\) with the same value of SOL staking reward, 7% of SOL reward will be kept in the staking pool and 93% will be SCA buyback.

There will be different tiers and address limits of pools to let users to stake SOL:

* 1 SOL/1000 address.
* 10 SOL/1000 address.
* 100 SOL/1000 address.

Our program will use the fund of pools to earn rewards by:

* Staking SOL on Solana Validator.
* Lending at some lending project.
* Liquidity mining at some liquidity pool.

You can see where the funds will go on our front-end.

### **Tasks**🏅**：**

During the game users can win Scallop Decorations or extra SPL token rewards by carrying out some tasks**.**

### Notice🔎**：**

* If users keep staking, they can join the harvesting of next week.
* We are going to use Switchboard VRF on Solana and it will help our program to choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week. 
* We will set up more pools with different maximum address limits or different token pools for users!
