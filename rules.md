### Rulesüìã**Ôºö**

Users can stake SOL to scallop tank and get a scallop to grow, after staking over 7 days users will have the qualification of harvest. **20:00 of every Friday \(GMT+8\)** will be the harvest time. After harvesting, one \(or a few\) of winner chosen by program randomly will get Scallop token \(SCA\) with 100% same value of SOL staking reward, 7% of SOL will keep in the staking pool, 93% will be SCA buyback.

During the game users can win the Scallop Decorations by carry out some tasks, like stake more than 10 SOL in the Scallop tank for a month or stake more than 10000 SCA in the staking pool for two weeks, we will show the tasks you can carry on our apps.

Our program will use the pool 's fund to earn rewards from :

* Staking SOL on Solana Validator.
* Lending at some lending project.
* Liquidity mining at some liquidity pool.

 You can see where will the funds go at our front-end.

* There will be extra partnership SPL token rewards. 
* If users didn't unstake theirs SOL, they can keep staking and join the harvesting of next week. 
* We are going to use Switchboard VRF which is a real random function on Solana that will help our program to choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week. 
* We will setup more pools with different maximum address limit or tokens for users!
