# Rules üë©‚Äçüè´

### Rulesüìã**Ôºö**

Users can deposit their tokens into Scallop Pools to grow scallops in Scallop Tank and join the no loss lottery, while deposit tokens users will get the same worth of Scallop Wrapped Token (such as sUSDC, sSOL, sUSDT.), the amount will be the same amount with the token they deposited.

Every Friday 20:00 (GMT+8) will be the harvest time, users will have the qualification of harvesting after staking over 7 days.

After harvesting, winners chosen by Switchboard VRF will share out the reward SCA (With the same value of 93% staking reward), and 7% of the lottery reward will be kept in the Scallop Pool.

We will set a ticket price, like 100 USDC pool, 1 SOL pool, etc. Users can buy more than 1 ticket at one Scallop Pool. The number of winners amount will be 1/1000 of the total address amount.

There will be different tiers of Scallop Pools with accepting different SPL tokens, different tokens amounts, different earning ways, ex:

* 10 SOL to stake at Marinade.
* &#x20;100 RAY to stake at Raydium.&#x20;
* 100 USDC to lend at Jet Protocol.&#x20;
* 100 USDT to do LP mining at ORCA.

You can see where the Scallop Pools fund will go, our program will use them to earn rewards by:

* Stake SOL on Solana Validator or other SOL staking protocols.&#x20;
* Stake the SPL tokens which have their own staking program.&#x20;
* Lend at some lending protocols.&#x20;
* Join some liquidity mining pools (Especially stable pools).

#### Noticeüîé**Ôºö**

* If users want to leave the Scallop Pool (Withdraw), they can choose to leave immediately and it will cost some fee, or they can leave after the next harvesting and he can‚Äôt be the winner in the week of leaving.
