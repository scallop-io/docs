# Rules 👩‍🏫

### Rules📋**：**

Users can stake their tokens into Scallop Pools to grow scallops in Scallop Tank, while they stake tokens, they can get the same worth of Scallop Token (SCA) as the token they staked.

**Every Friday 20:00 (GMT+8) will be the harvest time**, users will have the qualification of harvesting after staking over 7 days.

After harvesting, one or a few winner(s) chosen by** Switchboard VRF** (Verified Random Functions) will share out the reward SCA (With the same value of 93% staking reward), 7% of the staking reward will be kept in the staking pool and other will be SCA buyback.

There will be different tiers of pools with different address limits, different SPL tokens to let users stake tokens, ex:

* 10 SCA/1000 address
* 100 RAY/1000 address
* 10 SOL/1000 address
* 100 USDC/∞ address

You can see where the funds will go, our program will use them to earn rewards by:

* Stake SOL on Solana Validator.
*

    Stake SPL tokens.
*

    Lend to some lending projects.
*

    Join some liquidity mining pool.

#### Notice🔎**：**

* If users keep staking, they can harvest every week.
*

    Users can get back the token they staked while they return SCA.
