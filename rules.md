# Rules 👩‍🏫

### Rules📋**：**

Users can stake tokens to the Scallop tank and get a scallop to grow, after staking over 7 days users will have the qualification of harvest. **Every Friday 20:00 \(GMT+8\) will be the harvest time.** 



After harvesting, one \(or a few\) of winners chosen by program randomly will get Scallop token \(SCA\) with the same value of staking reward, 7% of staking reward will be kept in the staking pool and 93% will be SCA buyback.



There will be different tiers and address limits of pools to let users to stake tokens, ex:

* 1 SOL/1000 address.
* 10 SOL/1000 address.
* 100 SOL/1000 address.

You can see where the funds will go on the front-end, our program will use the fund of pools to earn rewards by:

* Staking SOL on Solana Validator.
* Lending at some lending project.
* Liquidity mining at some liquidity pool.

#### Notice🔎**：**

* If users keep staking, they can join the harvesting of next week.
* We are going to invoke Switchboard VRF on Solana and it will help our program to choose one \(or a few\) winner of each week. 
* We will set up more pools with different maximum address limits or different token pools for users!

### **Tasks**🏅**：**



We don’t want users to join us for months and get nothing so during the game: users can carry out some tasks like:

* Join 10 SOL lottery pools over a month.
* Stake more than 10K SCA over two weeks.
* Offer $100 to SCA/USDC Liquidity.



to win:

* Scallop Decorations
* Extra SPL token
* SCA
* NFTs





Extra SPL token rewards will be the token minted by partnership projects, we will use SCA or Scallop Decorations to trade their tokens or NFTs.
