# About Scallop ü¶™üç¥

## **What is Scallop?**

Scallop is a diverse no-loss protocol on Solana, it is a finance strategy that could maximize the potential yield with no principal loss. Users can deposit tokens into Scallop Pools, Scallop on-chain program will invoke lending, staking, and stable pool liquidity mining protocols to earn the yield. Every 24 hrs, a winner will be picked from each pool by the on-chain program to get most of the yields, and other yields will keep in the Scallop treasury.

Scallop has a user dashboard called Scallop Tank and on-chain collectibles called Scallop Decorations, Scallop Decorations will show up in Scallop Tank and interact with Scallop protocol, these features make Scallop become a unique Defi protocol.

Most of Scallop's team members are in Taiwan, they joined several Solana hackathons and did well in the Asia region. In Solana Ignition Asia, they got the highest community vote in over 40 projects. Scallop launched their Devnet beta in April 2022, and the Mainnet launching will be soon.
