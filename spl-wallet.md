Before you get started at Scallop, you'll need an SPL wallet for storing your funds on Solana and for interacting with the features on Scallop. Remember that you'll need some SOL in your wallet to complete any transactions on Solana.

Wallets we will support are listed below:

* Phantom
* Sollet.io
