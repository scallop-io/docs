# Earning Ways

There will be different types of Scallop pools that let users choose to, differentiate by the earning ways, we will have 3 ways to earn interest to be the lottery rewards, including staking, lending, and liquidity mining, we can even divide staking to SOL staking and SPL token staking.



### **Lending**

Lending is the most common way to earn interest for all no-loss lottery protocols, we might choose tokens like USDC, USDT, or SOL for lending because they have more users and higher APY, these are some great lending protocols on Solana:

* Solend (Priority)&#x20;
* Larix&#x20;



### **SOL Staking**

Stake SOL will be one of the ways for Scallop Pools to earn interest, SOL is the native token on Solana, we are also planning to set up our own Solana Validator in the future to earn SOL directly, it will also make Scallop protocol have it's own RPC node.

These are SOL staking tokenized protocols we can use:

* Marinade



### SPL tokens Staking

We will also let Scallop Pools earn the interest by staking some SPL tokens which their mother project has a staking program for their native token, like the projects listed below:

* Raydium
* Aldrin

It will also make Scallop protocol to be a unique Defi lego layer, you can also call it an extention layer.

### ****

### **Liquidity Mining**

We will also join liquidity pools to earn rewards, but there will be impermanent loss during liquidity mining, so we prefer some stable pools like:

* USDT/USDC at ORCA, Aldrin.&#x20;
* mSOL/SOL at Marinade, Quarry.

And to do liquidity ming the client usually needs to have two kinds of tokens to join it, we will invoke Jupiter Aggregator SDK to solve this issue.
