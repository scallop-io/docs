# About Scallop ü¶™üç¥

## **What is Scallop?**

Scallop is a diverse Defi protocol on Solana blockchain, main product is no loss lottery pool with ocean-themed, on-chain collectibles and NFTs. Users can join the no-loss lottery by depositing their tokens into Scallop no-loss pools, and Scallop on-chain program will invoke SOL or SPL token staking, lending, or liquidity mining protocols (especially stable pools) to earn the interest as the pool rewards.

At the end of each 24 hours, winners randomly chosen by Scallop on-chain program will share out some of the rewards, and the rest will go to the Scallop Treasury.

During the participation, users have chances to win extra tokens and Scallop NFTs by carrying out some tasks. We called Scallop NFTs "Scallop Decorations", it's like a small NFTs ecosystem, and Scallop Decorations will show up in Scallop Tank and interact with Scallop protocol.

Besides no-loss pools, Scallop will also have a swap program, SCA liquidity mining pools, and staking. In the early stage, Scallop will be more close to a diverse no-loss protocol with unique NFTs, we will make it become a play-to-earn Defi game in the future step by step.
