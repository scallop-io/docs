## **What is Scallop?**

What is Scallop? Scallop is a diverse no-loss protocol on Solana blockchain, users can deposit tokens into Scallop Pools, Scallop on-chain program will invoke lending, staking, and stable pool liquidity mining protocols to earn the yield. Every 24 hrs, a winner will be picked from each pool by the on-chain program to get most of the yields as the prize, and other yields will be in the Scallop treasury.

During the participation, users have chances to win extra tokens and Scallop NFTs by carrying out some tasks. We called Scallop NFTs "Scallop Decorations", it's like a small NFTs ecosystem, and Scallop Decorations will show up in Scallop Tank and interact with Scallop protocol.

Besides no-loss pools, Scallop will also have a swap program, SCA liquidity mining pools, and staking. In the early stage, Scallop will be more close to a diverse no-loss protocol with unique NFTs, we will make it become a play-to-earn Defi game in the future step by step.
