Scallop is a scallop growing simulation game on Solana with a user-funded pooled treasury, developed by three young engineers who love ocean across the globe. Users can stake theirs SOL here to grow a scallop and have chance to win extra rewards. At the end of each week, users will win Scallop Coin \(SCA\) and one \(or a few\) of winner choose by smart contract at random will get the pool's SOL rewards. 90% of pool's rewards will give to winners, 7% will back to the pool, 3% will be SCA buyback. During the game users can win the Scallop decorations by carrying out a taskâœ¨!
