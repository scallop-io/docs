# Create a SCA address



Navigate to your Solana wallet. In this guide, we will use Sollet, [https://sollet.io/](https://sollet.io/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Your wallet will need an amount of SOL to create the SCA address, typically between 0.0021 and 0.004 SOL. We recommend that your wallet has at least 0.01 SOL in it, especially if it's a newly created wallet.
{% endhint %}

Select the + button \("Add Token"\).

Select the "MANUAL INPUT" tab.

Enter the SCA token details:

* Token mint address: 
* Token name: `Scallop Coin`
* Token symbol: SCA

Click "ADD". Once your transaction is confirmed, you will see your SCA address within Sollet.

{% hint style="success" %}
You have successfully created a SCA account and address.
{% endhint %}

If you have any issues creating an account, check you have:

* enough SOL in your SOL account
* entered the correct Token Mint Address for SCA
