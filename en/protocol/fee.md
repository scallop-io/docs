# Fee

To ensure the long-term operation of the protocol, Scallop charges a certain percentage of transaction fees for specific functionalities. Additionally, Scallop incurs some basic operational costs, which include blockchain Gas Fees and Oracle consensus fees.

## Borrowing Fee

When users take out a loan through Scallop, a small borrowing fee is applied based on the asset category. Scallop classifies assets into three types—main assets, emerging assets, and isolated assets—reflecting different levels of risk. Accordingly, the borrowing fee varies: 0.3% for main assets, and 1% for both emerging and isolated assets. This fee is not an additional charge paid by the borrower but is directly deducted from the loan amount at the time of borrowing.

## Borrowing Interest Fee

When borrowers pay interest on their loans, a portion of this interest is allocated to the protocol as income. Each pool has its own borrowing interest fee, and the interest paid by borrowers is redirected to protocol.

## Liquidation Fee

When a user's account becomes unhealthy and undergoes liquidation, a specific fee is applied to the transaction as part of the liquidation process. In this scenario, 1% of the total amount obtained from the liquidation is allocated to the protocol as a form of income.

## Flash Loan Fee

When users utilize flash loans—a financial instrument allowing for the borrowing of assets without collateral for a concise duration, typically within a single transaction block—there is a unique fee structure in place. Specifically, for these transactions, 0.1% of the flash loan amount is allocated to the protocol as income.

## Scallop Swap Fee

There is a 0.01% fee for each swap transaction. This fee supports the protocol's ongoing growth and development, allowing us to deliver additional features and improvements.

## Sui Network Fee

Sui Network Fees are necessary for processing your transactions on Scallop. These Sui transaction fees are deducted from your wallet when your transaction is executed. (Usually less than 0.0001 SUI)

## Oracle Fee

We have added an extra layer of security to the oracle (the entity responsible for providing price information). As a tradeoff, you will need to pay an additional fee to fetch data from the multi-oracle. (Usually less than 0.01 SUI)
