# Emerging Asset

As the leading money market on Sui, Scallop is continuously striving to improve and expand our offerings for users.

With the launch of new tokens on the Sui Network, Scallop is excited to introduce a new feature — **Emerging Asset**!

Emerging Asset are a new addition to Scallop’s existing Main Asset and Isolated Asset structures. They provide a flexible and efficient pathway for newly launched or popular assets to be listed, while maintaining the overall stability and security of the protocol.

### Existing Scallop Assets&#x20;

Scallop previously supported two asset types: **Main Assets** and **Isolated Assets**.

* **Scallop Main Assets**: Main Assets are tokens that are widely supported across protocols on Sui. They generally have larger market caps, higher token liquidity, and lower price volatility. Borrowing Main Assets incurs a low borrowing fee of **0.3%**.
* **Scallop Isolated Assets**: Isolated Assets are newer tokens that typically experience higher price volatility. These tokens are placed into individual, isolated pools to manage risk separately from other assets. Borrowing Isolated Assets incurs a borrowing fee of **1%**, and users cannot borrow multiple assets under the same obligation.

### Introducing: Scallop Emerging Asset Pools

Scallop’s **Emerging Assets** introduce a new asset class that acts as an "intermediate" step between Main Assets and Isolated Assets.

**Key Features of Emerging Assets:**

* Can be **used as collateral**, similar to Main Assets, but with **lower collateral weight**.
* Borrowing Emerging Assets incurs a **1% borrowing fee**, the same as Isolated Assets.
* **Tighter risk parameters** compared to Main Assets to ensure stability.
* Designed to **bridge** newly launched tokens before they potentially graduate to Main Asset status.

### Initial Launch Assets

The initial Emerging Asset Pools will include:

* **WAL**
* **SCA**
* **DEEP**
* **CETUS**

More assets will be added to the Emerging Asset Pools in the coming weeks and months — stay tuned for updates!
