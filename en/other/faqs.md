In the example above, if you have debts of 0.97 and 0.98, when repaying these debts, we'll add a 1% charge from your account to ensure full debt clearance. Any excess from this 1% charge, after the debt is settled, will be refunded to you. This 1% is not kept by us; it's merely a precaution to guarantee that all debts are fully repaid, and it will be returned to you after repayment.
